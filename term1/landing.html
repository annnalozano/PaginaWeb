        <h1>Guillem's Lecture: </h1>
        <p>Some notes of Guillem’s Lecture:</p>
        <p>From convenience to expression technologies: “A shift in the focus of technologies, transitioning from primarily serving everyday tasks to becoming tools that foster creativity and individual expression.</p>
        <p>From Survival to Rebel technologies: It suggests a shift in the purpose or focus of technologies, transitioning from those designed for mere survival or basic needs to technologies that are used in a challenging or subversive manner.</p>   
        <p>From extractive to regenerative technologies: Change towards technologies that seek to restore and preserve the environment instead of depleting its resources.</p>

        <h1>Some notes of Laura’s Research background:</h1>

        <p>Topics i found interesting:</p>
        <p><em>Epistemology</em>:is the study of knowledge, and it focuses on understanding how we acquire knowledge, how we justify it, and how we assess its validity. This discipline engages in the analysis and evaluation of various epistemological theories and approaches, such as empiricism, rationalism, and constructivism, with the aim of deepening our understanding of knowledge and how we perceive it. </p>
        <p><em>Symbiosis</em>is a biological interaction in which two organisms of different species live in close proximity and establish a relationship in which both benefit. </p>
        <li>Mutualism: In mutualism, both species benefit from the relationship. </li>
        <li>Commensalism: In commensalism, one species benefits from the relationship while the other is neither significantly benefited nor harmed.</li>
        <li>Parasitism: In parasitism, one species (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (the host), which is harmed.
        </li>
        <p><em>Symbiocracy:  </em> In a general context, it refers to a system of government in which different groups or stakeholders work together in a symbiotic relationship to make decisions and manage common interests. It is often associated with the idea that the different involved parties collaborate rather than compete, seeking mutual and sustainable benefit.</p>
        <p><em>Anti - especismo :</em> t advocates for the moral equality of all animal species, regardless of their species. It opposes speciesism, which is discrimination based on species, and advocates that all sentient beings deserve ethical treatment and moral consideration. Speciesism involves giving preferential treatment or moral consideration to humans in comparison to other animal species. </p>
        <p>Elysa clorostica</p>
        <p>Kropotkin</p>
        <p><em>Biohacking: </em> It refers to the practice of biologically modifying and enhancing the human body by applying principles of engineering and technology. It involves the modification of aspects of human biology with the goal of improving performance, health, longevity, or even acquiring new abilities.
            Transhumanism.  </p>
        <p>Moral duty</p>
        <p>Darwinism</p>
        <p><em>Julian huxley:</em>He is known for his work in evolutionary synthesis, a school of thought that combines genetics andnatural selection in evolutionary theory. Advocate (defensor) of secular humanism.</p>
         <p>His focus on the improvement and evolution of humanity and his advocacy for an ethics based on reason and science have certain similarities with the fundamental principles of transhumanism, which aims to apply science and technology to overcome human limitations and enhance the human condition.</p>   
        <p>Tomàs Huxley : “Bulldog de Darwin”</p>    
         <p><em>Nick Bostrom:</em>He specializes in artificial intelligence, ethics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of technology. He is widely recognized for his contributions to the discussion on the future of artificial intelligence and superintelligence. </p>
         <p>He is an influential figure in the field of philosophy of technology and ethics of artificial intelligence. His work has significantly contributed to the understanding of the ethical and philosophical challenges posed by technological advancement and artificial intelligence.</p>   
            <p><em>Social neo darwinisme:</em>The term “social neo-Darwinism” is often used in a critical or derogatory context to describe erroneous or poorly-founded interpretations of Charles Darwin’s evolutionary theories, especially when applied inappropriately to human society or to political and ethical issues. It is sometimes used to refer to the misguided interpretation of natural selection and competition as justifications for human behavior, such as racism, sexism, or economic exploitation. </p>
            <p><em>British eugenic society:</em> Eugenics is the study or belief in the possibility of improving the human race through selective breeding or other forms of genetic manipulation. The British Eugenics Society was established in the early 20th century and aimed to apply the principles of eugenics to social policies and practices.</p>
            <p>Prominent figures associated with the British Eugenics Society include Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin and a pioneer in the field of eugenics. The society advocated for policies such as the sterilization of individuals deemed “unfit” for reproduction and promoted the idea of improving the human gene pool.</p>
