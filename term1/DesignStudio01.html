        <p><span class="treb">1st, 2nd and 3rd person perspective: </span></p>
        <p> <span class="treb">There are different approaches to relate to the socio-technical system object of study. 3rd person perspective relates to gathering information without getting involved, and a 2nd person perspective is about designing with a sample of the target group. In a 1st person perspective, the designer is part of a system within the existing social structures</span></p>
        <h1><span class="fantasy">Rols of Prototyping: Ways of Knowledge</span></h1>     
        <p><span class="treb"><strong>Role 1:</span></strong><span class="treb">The prototype as an experimental component
            to test specific hypotheses physically embedded (incrustado) in the artifact. It is ideal if you’re working on a project where you need to physically validate specific hypotheses. It’s particularly useful when you want to check if an idea or concept works in practice and meets certain criteria or requirements.</span></p>  
        <p><strong> <span class="treb">Role 2:</span></strong> <span class="treb">The prototype as a means of inquiry 
            to encourage (fomentar) reflection. It is relevant when you want to foster reflection and exploration. This approach is useful if you want to gain a deeper understanding of how users interact with a product or concept and how it relates to their experiences and emotions.</span></p>
        <p><strong> <span class="treb">Role 3:</span></strong><span class="treb">The prototype as a research archetype.
            Speculative Design . exposing confrontational or contradictory scenarios. It is well-suited for speculative design projects, where you aim to create provocative or contradictory scenarios to explore different possibilities and challenge conventional perceptions. This role is useful when you want to open up new perspectives and question the dogmas.</span></p>
        <p><span class="treb"><em> Role 4: </em></span> <span class="treb">The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquir.
            The process becomes a means of inquiry.
            The reasearch contribution is tied not to the artefact itself as much as to how the artefact was crafted. Enphasize how the prototype is created rather than just the final outcome. This can be useful when the design process itself is a fundamental part of your research. You can explore how iteration, design decisions, and methodologies affect the final result</span> </p>

        <span class="treb">We've designed a collective Design Intervention to explore how alterations of your face can change your perception of yourself; either hide a part of you or enhance it. We want to give the possibility of changing your face to a specific group of people, and allow them to reflect on reconfiguration of the body. This change they can apply to their faces, might be on purpose to hide a part they don't like or either enhance another one they love.
        For the intervention, we have organized an event or party at Everardo's house with our friends. We believe that the relaxed atmosphere of this type of space gives the participant more room to get carried away.
        Our intervention wants to explore the following questions:
        Did you choose to alter your face to hide or change a part of yourself you don't like? Or to enhace your existing identity?
        After changing your face, do you feel more like yourself or less like yourself? </span>

The connections results in an interaction between two digital models that actually touch and interact as if it were a condition of sexual intimacy that brings pleasure.</p>
