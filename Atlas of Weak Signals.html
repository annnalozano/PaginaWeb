<p><span>brainstorming together to collect all current trends, challenges, opportunities clustered around the policrisis themes (knowing-in-action)</span></p>

<p><span>Connect the different trends to show there intersectionality (connection line tool.    )</span></p>

It’s aim is to identify potential opportunities, challenges, and likely future developments relevant to your topic of investigation. Horizon Scanning is not about making predictions, it’s about exploring new, interesting, emerging futures, as well as persistent challenges and trends today. There’s no “right” at this stage, you just need to map what’s going on.</span></p><p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJXS-WhgR.png" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><span>ACTIVITY 03: FRAMING SIGNALS</span></strong><br>
<strong><span>Theme Selected: Technology</span></strong></p><ul>
<li><span>Define your topic clearly with your team and make sure you are all having the same understanding of the included terminology.</span></li>
</ul><p><span>The CIPHER* acronym describes six indicators for trends, the aim of using</span><br>
<span>them is to uncover hidden patterns and to understand what does a trend or a driver really mean, does it have any connection with other trends? Or does</span><br>
<span>it indicate a radical change that might happen?</span></p><p><span>Each of the categories is described in the template.</span></p><p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1ZvgZ2l0.png" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><span>ACTIVITY 04:</span></strong></p><ul>
<li><span>Create prototypes of your theme and connected weak signals</span></li>
</ul><p><span>Our cards ranged from concepts involving the fusion of physical and technological elements to how we’ll navigate coexistence with these technologies.</span></p><p><span>concept of Redefining Realities: In the WEB 3.0 &amp; 4.0 era, the balance between humanity and technology is crucial. Some argue that the rights of machines should not surpass those of humans. For instance, in the reality world, people might feel disoriented without technology, and time serves as a good example. Only through technology, such as electronic screens, can people become aware of the existence of time, which might simply be a series of numbers.</span></p><p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkJKyZhgC.png" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p><span>Immersive Technologies.</span><br>
<span>Virtual Reality : "Virtual reality" is a technology that allows users to immerse themselves in a computer-generated environment that simulates physical or imaginary reality.</span></p><p><span>Key Words: Simulation, Reality, Virtuality, Augmented, Immersive, Experience, Sensorial</span></p><p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r13ZJWneA.png" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><span>ACTIVITY 05: Provocation polarisation:</span></strong></p><ul>
<li>
<p><span>Position your chosen THEME at the center of the floor/ canvas. One group at a time will add the theme, each theme will be discussed.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Collaboratively assess and review the empty areas of the circle, discuss if there are signals that can be added to create balance.</span></p>

This process has not only enriched my understanding of the topic but has also been a reflective exercise that has allowed me to visualize my goals and future direction more clearly.</span></p><p><span>I have been able to delve into the intersections between technology and our daily lives while also opening up new areas of interest regarding the subject.</span></p></div>
