<span>permeability life would not be possible, which is giving and receiving,</span><br>
<span>exchange, crossing barriers. And even more than transcendent, the border</span><br>
<span>is provocative, rising as a challenge, a loving invitation to be crossed, to</span><br>
<span>be possessed, to surrender to give us our overcoming with its expiration:</span><br>
<span>that is the deep charm of border living. Charm composed of ambivalence,</span><br>
<span>ambiguity—they are not the same—, of interpenetration, of living here</span><br>
<span>and there at the same time without erasing differences. Beyond, the other</span><br>
<span>tempts us, what we don't have: the frontier sings it to us and</span><br>
<span>promises it to us.”</span></em></p><p><span>From my perspective and in relation to my themes of interest, the concept of boundary is fundamental to question and explore. Additionally, it has served me to continue giving substance to my artistic practice and line of research.</span></p><p><strong><span>Between systems:</span></strong><br>
<span>During this 2nd trimester, they have been my first tangible results in the creation of projects with substance and coherence, which align with my clear and defined thematic focus and interest. These reflections and visions took shape for the first time in Gaia, a project that my peers and I presented during Design Dialogues II. Gaia represents my initial effort, both imaginative and practical, to establish a symbiotic relationship between technology and nature.</span></p><p><span>During the Research trip, I wanted to continue exploring these two systems through different elements and tools.</span></p><h2 id="The-Phygital" data-id="The-Phygital" style=""><span>The Phygital</span></h2><p><em><span>Partner in crime : Nicolò Baldi</span><br>
